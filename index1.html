          Hello everyone…
          Myself Meenakshi…, I belong to Hyderabad,
          I have completed my graduation..
          There are four members in my family including me… my father, my mother and my one and only brother..
          My father is an LIC agent, my mother is a housewife and my brother is working as a software employee in a reputed company..
          I like to do creative things like drawing, painting and stitching. I like to spend my time with my family and my friends..
          Listening music, watching TV, net surfing and learning & knowing something new are my hobbies..

          My short term goal is to work in a good company where I enhance my knowledge and my skill and show my talent. My long term goal is to get a very respectable position where I
          make my parents to smile and feel proud. I have some weak points like I am little bit lazy about which I am not interested. I can't say no if someone asks for help. My strengths are I am a good learner and very punctual. I am self-motivated and simple girl/boy with positive attitude towards my career.
